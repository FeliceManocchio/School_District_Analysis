# School_District_Analysis
School standardized test analysis
## Overview and Purpose
### Analysis Objective
The data in this module contains standardized testing results for math and reading within local schools. The school board suspects our original analysis of student performance is skewed due to academic dishonesty from the 9th graders in Thomas High School. We must first remove the scores of the 9th graders in Thomas High School then re-analyze the performance of all the students on the standardized test with respect to the math and reading scores. After we come up with the new analysis we can then back track and look at how much the scores were affected by removing the 9th graders from Thomas High School.
## Results
### Original District Analysis
Below is an image of the original analysis we ran within the district with the 9th graders test scores factored in, followed by the new district analysis. We can see that on a district level there was not a change in overall performance within math and reading test scores.
